# Active Context - Pakistan Medical Industry Drug Database Scraper

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Implementing a comprehensive web scraper for dawaai.pk that extracts medicine data and stores it in MSSQL database with multi-execution security and anti-blocking measures.

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Core Infrastructure**: Complete project structure implemented
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: MSSQL table with all required fields
- ‚úÖ **Basic Scraping**: Medicine link extraction and data processing
- ‚úÖ **Anti-Blocking**: Rotating user agents, delays, retry logic
- ‚úÖ **Image Download**: Medicine image downloading and storage
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Execution Security**: External ID-based duplicate prevention
- ‚úÖ **Configuration**: Environment-based database configuration
- ‚úÖ **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system
- üîÑ **Data Extraction Refinement**: Improving brand name and price extraction
- üîÑ **Medicine Link Coverage**: Ensuring all medicine variants are captured

## Recent Changes and Decisions

### Database Schema Evolution
1. **Initial Schema**: Basic fields (SystemId, ExternalId, CompleteName, GenericName, etc.)
2. **Enhanced Schema**: Added BrandName, PackSize, Price fields
3. **Final Schema**: Separated listing and detail page prices for comprehensive coverage

### Data Extraction Improvements
1. **Brand Name Extraction**: 
   - Initial: Basic CSS selector extraction
   - Current: Text-based extraction with promotional content filtering
   - Issue: Capturing unwanted promotional text ("10% OffArnilBrookes")

2. **Price Extraction**:
   - Initial: Single price field
   - Current: Separate columns for listing and detail page prices
   - Pattern: "Rs 226Rs 252" format handling

3. **Pack Size Extraction**:
   - Initial: Parsing from complete name
   - Current: Direct extraction from listing page ("Pack Size: 1x10's")

### Medicine Link Coverage Issue
**Problem Identified**: Scraper missing medicine variants with same name but different strengths
- Example: "Aurora 10mg tablet 1x10's" (aurora-tab-5mg-10s-36775) ‚úÖ Added
- Example: "Aurora 20mg tablet 1x10's" (aurora-44165) ‚ùå Skipped

**Root Cause**: CSS selectors not comprehensive enough to capture all medicine containers
**Solution**: Implemented dual-method link extraction (direct link search + container-based search)

## Current Technical Challenges

### 1. Brand Name Data Quality
**Issue**: Brand names containing promotional content
- Current: "10% OffArnilBrookes", "10% OffArtifenAbbott"
- Desired: "ArnilBrookes", "ArtifenAbbott"

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
def _clean_promotional_text(self, text):
    promotional_patterns = [
        r'10%\s*Off', r'\d+%\s*Off', r'Off\s*',
        r'Discount', r'Sale', r'Promotion'
    ]
    # Remove promotional content before brand extraction
```

### 2. Medicine Link Coverage
**Issue**: Not all medicine variants being captured
**Solution Implemented**:
```python
# Method 1: Direct link search
all_links = soup.find_all('a', href=True)
for link in all_links:
    if '/medicine/' in link.get('href'):
        medicine_links.append(link)

# Method 2: Container-based search (fallback)
if len(medicine_links) < 10:
    # Use container-based approach
```

### 3. Price Extraction Accuracy
**Issue**: Prices appearing as concatenated strings
**Solution Implemented**:
```python
# Pattern: "Rs 226Rs 252"
price_pattern = r'Rs\s*(\d+(?:,\d+)*)Rs\s*(\d+(?:,\d+)*)'
price_match = re.search(price_pattern, container_text)
```

## Next Steps and Priorities

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. **Test Enhanced Link Extraction**: Verify all medicine variants are captured
2. **Validate Brand Name Cleaning**: Ensure promotional content is properly filtered
3. **Test Price Extraction**: Confirm both listing and detail prices are captured correctly
4. **Run Full Scraping Test**: Test with letter 'a' to validate complete workflow

### Short-term Goals (This Week)
1. **Complete Data Quality Validation**: Ensure all fields are properly extracted
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize scraping speed while maintaining anti-blocking
3. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Improve error recovery for edge cases
4. **Documentation Update**: Update README with latest features and usage

### Medium-term Goals (Next Month)
1. **Full A-Z Scraping**: Complete scraping of all letters
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze scraped data for completeness and quality
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create basic monitoring for scraping progress
4. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production environment

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### 1. External ID Strategy
**Decision**: Use URL-based external IDs for duplicate prevention
**Rationale**: Each medicine has unique URL, even if names are similar
**Implementation**: Extract from `/medicine/{medicine-id}.html` pattern

### 2. Two-Phase Data Extraction
**Decision**: Extract basic data from listing page, detailed data from detail page
**Rationale**: Listing page has prices and pack sizes, detail page has complete information
**Implementation**: Pass listing data to detail page extraction

### 3. Separate Price Columns
**Decision**: Store listing and detail page prices separately
**Rationale**: Prices may differ between pages, need to capture both sources
**Implementation**: ListingPrice, ListingOriginalPrice, DetailPrice, DetailOriginalPrice

### 4. Anti-Blocking Strategy
**Decision**: Multiple layers of anti-blocking measures
**Rationale**: Website may block automated requests
**Implementation**: Rotating user agents, random delays, exponential backoff

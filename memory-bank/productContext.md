# Product Context - Pakistan Medical Industry Drug Database

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The Pakistan medical industry lacks a comprehensive, centralized database of medicines available in the market. Healthcare professionals, pharmacists, and researchers need access to:
- Complete medicine information (names, generics, brands)
- Pricing information from reliable sources
- Medicine images for identification
- Manufacturer/brand information
- Package sizes and formulations

### Current Challenges
1. **Scattered Information**: Medicine data is spread across multiple websites and sources
2. **Inconsistent Data**: Different sources provide different information formats
3. **Manual Collection**: No automated way to gather comprehensive medicine data
4. **Limited Coverage**: Existing databases don't cover the full spectrum of medicines
5. **Outdated Information**: Manual updates lead to stale data

### Market Need
- **Healthcare Professionals**: Need quick access to medicine information
- **Pharmacists**: Require comprehensive medicine databases for dispensing
- **Researchers**: Need structured data for pharmaceutical research
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Require complete medicine registries
- **Pharmaceutical Companies**: Need market intelligence and competitor analysis

## How It Should Work

### Data Collection Process
1. **Systematic Scraping**: Visit each letter page (A-Z) on dawaai.pk
2. **Comprehensive Extraction**: Extract all medicine links from listing pages
3. **Detailed Data Mining**: Visit each medicine detail page for complete information
4. **Image Download**: Download and store medicine images
5. **Database Storage**: Store all data in structured MSSQL database

### User Experience Goals
1. **Reliability**: System should run multiple times without data loss or duplication
2. **Completeness**: Capture all available medicines from the source website
3. **Accuracy**: Extract precise information without errors
4. **Performance**: Efficient scraping with minimal resource usage
5. **Monitoring**: Clear visibility into scraping progress and results

### Data Quality Standards
1. **Completeness**: All required fields should be populated when available
2. **Accuracy**: Data should match source website exactly
3. **Consistency**: Uniform format across all records
4. **Uniqueness**: No duplicate entries for same medicine variants
5. **Timeliness**: Data should reflect current website state
